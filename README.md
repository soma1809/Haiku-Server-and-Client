# Haiku-Server-and-Client <br/>
This is the Java Code for a Haiku Server and Client. <br/>
A server listens on port 5575 on the localhost. <br/>
Whenever a client connects to the server (using port 5575), the server returns a haiku (choosing randomly from 10 haikus) to the client and closes the connection.
